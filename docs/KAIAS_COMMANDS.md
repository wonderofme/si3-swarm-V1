### Multiple Ways to Say Things
Kaia recognizes variations:
- "Match" = "Find a match" = "Connect me" = "Find someone"
- "History" = "My matches" = "My profile" = "Show history"

### Context Matters
Kaia remembers your conversation:
- If you're in onboarding, she'll continue the flow
- If you've completed onboarding, she'll respond to general questions
- She remembers your language preference

### Error Handling
If something doesn't work:
